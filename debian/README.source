This package provides only the Go runtime for ANTLR4.

ANTLR4 itself and runtimes for other languages are packaged in seperate sources.
See https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2021/07/msg00014.html for the reasoning
behind this.

To keep packaging simple, any files other than the Go module
github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr itself and LICENSE, README and
contributors files are filtered out of the upstream tarball.

See debian/gbp.conf for a detailed list of files excluded.
